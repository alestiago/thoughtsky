# Thoughtsky
Thoughtsky was built in three days as part of the FlutterVikings 2020 Conference to exemplify the use of the **@Protocol** developed by the @Company.

## App Details
Thoughtsky encourages self-reflection and openness with our loved ones by providing a **safe space for journaling and communication** that guarantees hassle-free privacy, thanks to the @protocol.

When we share our thoughts, we are trusting others with access to small portions of our mind. No company should own those small portions of "data" that are deeply personal to us. The only way we can maintain this openness in our relationships online is by ensuring control over our own data. 

Thoughtsky is a small conceptual preview of a future internet that employs the @Protocol to ensure our control.
