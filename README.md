# Thoughtsky
## Authors' notice
Thoughtsky is a conceptual Flutter application that exemplifies one possible use of the **@Protocol**, developed by the @ Company.

We built it from scratch in less than **three days** as part of the FlutterVikings 2020 challenge by the @ Company. 

Due to the challenge's demanding deadline, our app's functionality may be limited and the code may still contain errors. If you would like to check it out we recommend using a Nexus 6P API 25 emulator and follow the [Set-up instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1V3kZot4vWsn2f9B3Sy0P5OesCQXigypxFCNpqoBKs/edit) provided by the @ protocol.

## App Description
Thoughtsky encourages self-reflection and openness with our loved ones by providing a **safe space for journaling and communication** that guarantees hassle-free privacy, thanks to the @protocol.

When we share our thoughts, we are trusting others with access to small portions of our mind. No company should own those small portions of "data" that are deeply personal to us. The only way we can maintain this openness in our relationships online is by ensuring control over our own data. 

Thoughtsky is a small conceptual preview of a future internet that employs the @Protocol to ensure our control.
